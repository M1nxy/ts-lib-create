## Usage
To create a project inside a named directory run `ts-lib-create <projectname>` this will create a folder with a template library. To create  a project inside the current directory run `ts-lib-create`. (Folder must not exist and must be empty prior to project init. Can be overridden with the `-f` flag)
## Installation
To install this tool run `npm install ts-lib-create`. I recommend installing it globally with the `-g` flag as it will only need to be installed once. (The removal process is the same: `npm uninstall ts-lib-create`)
